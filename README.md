Dungeon Board
=============

A board game map viewer for game masters to show players maps and dungeons without spoiling too much.

The repository was forked from one at the URL "https://github.com/McAJBen/DungeonBoard", and swiftly and brutally (and yet somehow still lackadaisically) refactored, with little regard for, or even knowledge of, accepted Java coding standards.  Please refer to the original repository for historical context, usage details and examples, and some kickass paintings of dragons.
